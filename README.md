# uiux-projects
Welcome to my Figma Projects Showcase! This repository is a collection of my design work built using Figma, highlighting my skills in UI/UX DesignðŸŽ¨. Each project reflects my approach to clean, user-focused design and attention to detail.

1.This is a UI/UX design project for a responsive e-commerce website, created entirely in Figma. The goal was to craft a clean, intuitive interface that enhances the shopping experience from browsing to checkout, while maintaining a consistent and modern visual identity.

4.This project is a Resource Page UI/UX design, created entirely by me using Figma. The goal was to build a centralized hub where users can explore and contribute useful resources (like articles, videos, tools, templates, etc.) in a structured and accessible way. The design focuses on clarity, usability, and scalability, making it suitable for integration into larger platforms or communities.
